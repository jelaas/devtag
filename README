The devname configurations are saved in '/etc/devtag.d' or '$HOME/.devtag.d'.
devtag [-hl] [--ns TAG CMD..] [-c TAG SEL..] [TAG]
 version 1.0.6
 -l --list
      list devnames and lookup info
 --ns TAG CMD ARG*
      Runs 'CMD' or bash in a separate mount name space.
      This name space has its own mount of /dev with a devicenode created
      according to configuration of the devtag 'TAG'.
 -c --create TAG SELECTOR+
      'TAG' is your handle for the device that matches the given selectors.
      'SELECTOR' is a 'name=value' pair. Suitable selectors is reported by the
      '--list' option.
 Without an argument:
      Scans for and prints device information suitable as selectors for the
      --create option.
 Without exactly one argument [TAG]:
      Lookup device node for devtag 'TAG'. Print result on stdout.
 If invoked as 'devtagns' the program will behave as the '--ns' option was given.

 Magic selectors (maybe not reported by devname-info):
  dev=<pattern>               device name pattern for selecting device node
  devname=<nodename>          devname-set will use this constant name for the device node
  class=<subsystem>           class is usb by default

The devname configurations are saved in '/etc/devtag.d' or '$HOME/.devtag.d'.
